= Towards a better Windows setup for developers

Git-bash is the "leanest-and-meanest" way to use Windows from the command line. In spite of this, there are some problems.

# Cygwin
Cygwin might be present. This interferes with the PATH variable.

# Filename completion.
Filename completion is not on the tab key by default. It's on ESC

# No bookmarking. We write and introduce the `aa` command for this.

# Visual Studio is the most common IDE on Windows. We must be able to start Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code from git-bash

# You cannot easily start Windows apps from git-bash without the shell "remembering" them - it then reports job status. When you 
are starting, for example, Chrome, you do not want bash to remember a job number. There should be an easy way to "start-and-forget" any job.

# You need a few common git-related aliases (e.g. gs = git status, gpu = git push origin/master, gdiff etc.)

# You need a sensible git diff-tool preset.

# You need a far better PS1 prompt

# You need the terminal title to be set properly (i.e. to the current branch and commit)

# You need the dotnet tool to work properly and you need to be able to add your own extensions to it.
